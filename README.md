# LagtutorApp10
LagTutor 1.0 Android App was first published on PlayStore on February 2019

This LagTutor Android application is my first published android app. 
The app contains links to usefull resources to help candidates prepare for success
in their Nigerian University entrance exams.

I had started learning how to build android apps a few months earlier in a hands-on style
and this app built using java in Android Studio is a practical manifestation of
my understanding of how to build android apps as of February 2019.

I have since improved. The most recent published version of the app can be seen on 
Google Playstore at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lagtutor.android.lagtutorapp 

By the way I learned using the lessons and accompanying labs at:
